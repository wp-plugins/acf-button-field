Forked from: https://github.com/envex/acf-button-field

The original didn't seem to be updated or maintained, and I needed this for a client, so here's the fork. 

Here's a quick list of the updates made:

= 1.0 =

* Removed all ACF 3 code
* Fixed bug with $button = $field['value'];
* Added class names to button output for styling. Class names automatically output based on Field label.
